    #1. What is higher-order function and how it is different from functor? 

    #A higher order function is a function that would contain other functions as a parameters or it would return the function as
    an output. It basically is a function that would operate within another function. 
    A functor is used when you want to hide the implementations. It basically would call a different function but not make an explicit call for a specific
    function in which functors would help with this. It also doesn't disturb the users code.


    #2. What are First-class objects?  What is the significance of functions being First-class objects? 

    # A first class object is an object that is able to be stored in a data structure which would be passed into an arguement or a 
    control structure. The significance of a first-class object is that there are a lot of properties that python has which would be first clas functions
    such as a function would be an instance of an object type. Another significance is that you would be able to store functions in variable and be able to pass parameters to another function or be able to return the function from another function. 

    #3 What are inner functions?  What is the major benefit of inner functions and why is it important for decorator 

    #inner functions within a decorator is called a wrapper. WHat it does is that it allows a programmer to modify the behavior of a function or a class. In the decorators the arguement would be taken into another function and then it is called inside a wrapper function.

    #4 Why @ symbol is called syntactic sugar?  What's the biggest advantage of using it when decorators are used? 

    an @ symbol is called a syntactic sugar because it was always something that was associated with decorators. This would be the same way as calling the function in the defintion. Why this would be so important it would have an advantage of this syntax is that it would allow for a better readability of the code which would be able to have the person reading x,y,z of code to be simple and clear. 

    #5 How would it help Python's weak OOP encapsulation of Class?  (Hint: google "Python @Property decorator")
    
    # When using a decorator it would add some functionalities to an already defined function. Due to everything in python being an object the functions in python this would mean that it would be referenced by a variable added in the lists to be passed as an arguement in another function. By using something like @property it would be the same way as using setters and getters in OOP which would make a lot of things much simpler.
